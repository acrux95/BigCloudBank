UI Design &amp; Layout

This is my firs UI Design and Layout, I made it with:

- Drafts with Invision 
- Wireframes with Figma 
- Work Simulation with Overflow
- Snippets of code with Zepplin

It takes a lot time because I did'nt use any application of these, but I feel very good because I'd finish the challenge and learn this part.

The repositories to view the page render are:
